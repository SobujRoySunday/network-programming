## üöÄ How to Run

Make sure you have a Linux environment with GCC installed. Then:

```bash
# Navigate to a task directory
cd 05-simple-client-server

# Compile the server
gcc server.c -o server

# Compile the client
gcc client.c -o client

# Run the server in one terminal
./server

# Run the client in another terminal
./client
